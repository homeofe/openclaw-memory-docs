## T-001: Define v0.2 roadmap items as issues and prioritize

**Goal:** Create a clear v0.2 roadmap by writing GitHub issues for each planned feature and ordering them by priority.

**Context:**
- v0.1.1 scaffold is in place
- Depends on `@elvatis_com/openclaw-memory-core` for core utilities
- No formal roadmap or issue tracker has been populated yet

**What to do:**
1. Review `index.ts` to identify gaps and planned features
2. Open GitHub issues for each roadmap item with clear acceptance criteria
3. Add priority labels (high / medium / low)
4. Update `DASHBOARD.md` with the new task list
5. Update `STATUS.md` after completion

**Definition of done:**
- [ ] At least 3 GitHub issues created and labeled
- [ ] `DASHBOARD.md` updated with new tasks
- [ ] `STATUS.md` updated
